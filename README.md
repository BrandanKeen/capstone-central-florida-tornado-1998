# 🌪️ Capstone: Central Florida Tornado Outbreak (1998)

This repository contains work completed for the *Data Analysis in Meteorology* capstone course at Florida Institute of Technology. It showcases the use of Python, Jupyter Notebooks, radar software, satellite data, and geospatial tools such as QGIS for the analysis and visualization of the 1998 Central Florida Tornado Outbreak.

The objective of this repository is to demonstrate the technical skills, scientific tools, and meteorological reasoning applied throughout the development of this project.

Each project folder includes:
- Output figures (`.png`)
- The exact code used to generate each figure (`.ipynb` or `.py`)
- A short `README.md` describing the purpose, method, and interpretation of each figure
